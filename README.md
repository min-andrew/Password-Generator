## Description

With the provided source code, we added javascript that added functionality to create a random password based on specific criteria. The specific criteria include uppercase, lowercase, special, and numerical values. Along with the randomized values, we also added the functionality to determine the length of the random password.

## Help

Note: If you input a decimal, it'll round to the nearest whole number and generate a password based on that length value.
